  <b>Machine Learning Models for Eardrum frames classification and Comparison</b><br>
</h1>

## Description:
This is a project implementing six machine learning models and comparing classification performances between two sets of image datasets, which is part of a bigger AI developing research project. The image datasets comes from both AI and human frame selection of clinical otoscope videos (private to the company, not included) on human eardrums, each ideally representing the single most diagnostically informative frame of the few second videos. The purpose of this project is to validate the performance of the frame selection algorithm of the developing AI by comparing classification results of auto-selected frames with results of human-selected frames of same set of videos.

## Requirements:
